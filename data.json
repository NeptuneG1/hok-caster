    "Description": "Use Garo's Skill 2 to reduce enemy Health from far away. Enable Skill 1 to have a greater Basic Attack range.\nGaro doesn't have any escape skill, so get the good position before attacking in a team fight. Don't activate her ultimate unless you get the good position.\nGaro gets benefit when using critical items because of her Ultimate Ultimate (read the ultimate description so you would understand it).\nGaro is marksman that can counter hero that depend on shield, it deals 200% damage to shield.\nGaro's Skill 1 consume mana and give attack delay but give you great attack range and deal continuous damage per-hit. Use 1st skill wisely in early game to just poke enemies. When you already unlock the Ultimate Ultimate and get at least 1 item, don't fear to attack enemies in team fight. Focus to upgrade this skill after level 1.\nGaro's Skill 2 is also poking skill, you can use it to harass enemies or to clear lane faster. Upgrade 2nd skill in level 1 so you can clear lane faster than enemy's marksman. It also applied silence.\nGaro's Ultimate Ultimate has passive and active skill. Passive it gives enemies slow when you applied critical hit. Active it create warzone/circle area that buff you, give you attack speed and critical rate. It has weakness, Garo needs on the warzone area to get those temporary buff. So never use the ability unless initiator in enemies already use their main initiate skill to your allies.",
